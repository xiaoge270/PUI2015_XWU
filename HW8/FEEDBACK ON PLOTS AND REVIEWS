i am confused about your plot, which is not reproducible or documented. your reviewes are ok, but generally a bit superficial
focusing on a singel issue per plot 9/10

NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
===============================

3D completely confuses the message. 3D plus obstruction and overlap makes the plot unreadable. 

color unexplained

gender is not a fractional value so all but 0 and 1 tick labels should be removed and 0 and 1 substituted with male and female

class is also integer: one must remove the .5 labels

NOTES ON THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
===============================
sz
===
a meaningful comparison is impossible due to the large difference in the men values. if that was the point then a time series would be unnecessary. if the structure should have been compared then a time series should have been modified by multiplying by an appropriate constant and indicating that in the legend 

small axes labels

the axis labels should be words, not variable names: startdate -> "start date (startdate)"

mu
==

interesting plot: the choice of plotting with small points allows the structure in the data to be seen

robust to color blindness

the three default dots in the legend should be changed to 1 as they are redudnant

ec
==
the 3d obstructs the structure, but the structure is symmetric so this is justified

the color is redundant with the z axis, but it helos read the y value in the 3D structure

the z axis label is ambiguous: spell the function out

the axis labels are too small to be readable
