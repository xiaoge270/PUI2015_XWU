The plot use appropriate colors and graphical elements to clearly show the comparison of usage between subway and Citibike in Winter 2013/2014. I can tell, from the peaks and valleys of the red line, that the usage of subway dramatically increase in the middle of December and drop near Christmas holiday. However, because the total number of Citibike rides is relatively small compared with subway use, the blue line in the plot may not present a clear trend of the usage of Citibike. My suggestion would be match the total number of entries for subway and Citibike to a similar level to make the comparison.
