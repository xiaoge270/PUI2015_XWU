The plot shows a beautiful 3D figure for function=x1^2-x2^2, which is easy to understand. Colors and graphical elements are appropriate. However, the plot may not be a reproduction of a dataset so I cannot really tell the information behind this it. My suggestion would be go to find a dataset and do some analysis on it, then generate a beautiful 3D plot.
