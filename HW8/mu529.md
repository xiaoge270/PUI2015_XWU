The plot shows a clear picture of average residential unit size for new buildings and renovated buildings. Colors and graphical elements are appropriate, except the definition of “New Buildings” and “Original” are kind of confused me. I can see from the plot that there are no renovations for buildings from 1880-1900. From 1900 to 1980, the average residential unit sizes for new buildings are larger than renovations. And they are approaching the same after the year of 2000. The plot is very informative and easy to understand. My only suggestion would be rethink the title and legend names.
